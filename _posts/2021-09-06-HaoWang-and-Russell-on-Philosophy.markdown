> We know more about what we know than how we know what we know. We know relatively better what we believe than what ultimate justifications of our beliefs are. (Wang Hao, 1971,1) 

> I would like to begin and end with a classification of what philosophy has to attend to. The guiding principle is, I believe, to do justice to what we know, what we believe, and how we feel.
Hao Wang, Beyond Analytic Philosophy

王浩的那句话其实和孔子的“知之为知之，不知为不知，是知也”是一样的，一直以来人们都太过于强调这句话的后一半了。
