## Mr.Basile

Once upon a time there was a Mr.Basile,

Wore a white cap and drove a white truck,

delivering milk to our doorstep.

<br/>

When I was 5 years old,

He noted my eyes couldn’t take off the belt,

and he gave me the coin.

<br/>
 

As my mother penned a note,

the buttermilk would appear.
 
<br/> 

In the bottle
 
<br/>

Magically
 
<br/> 

He had a key of our home,

sometimes he took a break at our kitchen room,

Having a cup and telling the story of he delivery.

(When it was cold outside, we put the box indoor.)

<br/>
 

Now there is only an old milk box,

and every often my son’s friends will ask:

“What it is?”

<br/>
 

Doesn’t matter,

it’s just we see the past,

and they will go to the tomorrow.
